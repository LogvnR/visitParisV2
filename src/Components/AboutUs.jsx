            Beyond the glitter of the Eiffel Tower and the allure of the Mona
            Lisa, there is the city of Paris itself. Its people, its cuisine,

            with Paris’s hidden history, its neighborhoods, its beautiful
            structures and its cheese and wine shops. Take a walk down the
            Champs-Élysées and admire Parisian high fashions. After, explore
            your local guide’s favorite neighborhood shops. With visit
            <span>Paris</span>, go beyond the guidebook and experience the real
            Paris.
